# Some quick words

Like it says in the quick description of the repo, this is a reupload of the `vhci-hcd` project
found on SourceForge. However, I made some changes to the Makefile and source files to
allow me to compile the kernel modules on my kernel, which is just Linux 6.13.0-rc1 based on
a mostly normal Arch 6.12.X config and built with LLVM instead of GCC.


The original readme is down below.
